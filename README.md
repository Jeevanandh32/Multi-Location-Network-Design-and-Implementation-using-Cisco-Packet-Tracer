Designed a hierarchical inter-network infrastructure for a multinational organization using Cisco Packet Tracer, incorporating OSPF as the inter-AS routing protocol for all WAN-connected locations.
Configured VLANs for optimized traffic segmentation and enhanced security, with PVST and HSRP to improve network redundancy and failover performance.
Implemented Router-on-a-Stick for inter-VLAN routing with dedicated DHCP servers for efficient IP address allocation, further enhanced by NAT and VPN tunnels for secure connectivity.
Strengthened network security by mitigating vulnerabilities through MAC flooding protection, MAC spoofing prevention, port security, and extended access control lists (ACLs).
