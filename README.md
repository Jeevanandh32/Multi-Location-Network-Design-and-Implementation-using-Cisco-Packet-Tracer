MULTI-LOCATION NETWORK DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

This repository showcases a project focused on designing and implementing a multi-location networking strategy for a small organization with five branch offices: Boston, Mumbai, New York, London, and Germany. The project demonstrates advanced networking concepts, including VLANs, OSPF routing, HSRP configuration, and security measures.

Features
- IP Subnetting: Efficient allocation of IPs for different departments across all locations.
- DHCP Configuration: Centralized and decentralized DHCP setup for dynamic IP allocation.
- VLAN Implementation: Logical segmentation of networks to improve security and reduce broadcast traffic.
- OSPF Routing: Optimized dynamic routing across all locations for faster convergence.
- HSRP Configuration: High availability for gateway redundancy at critical locations.
- Security Measures: Implementation of network security policies, including access control lists (ACLs).
- Network Optimization: Fine-tuning of configurations for high performance and reliability.

Prerequisites
- Networking equipment (e.g., Cisco routers and switches or a network simulation tool like Cisco Packet Tracer).
- Basic knowledge of networking concepts, including VLANs, routing protocols, and DHCP.

Getting Started

Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MULTI-LOCATION-NETWORK-DESIGN.git
cd MULTI-LOCATION-NETWORK-DESIGN
```

Configuration Details
- Each location is assigned specific VLANs for departments (e.g., HR, Technical, Finance).
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) managed on servers located in the Technical VLAN.
- OSPF implemented for routing between locations with proper area designations.
- High-availability setup using HSRP at key locations.

How It Works
1. VLANs are created and assigned to departments to logically segment the network.
2. OSPF routing ensures efficient inter-location communication.
3. HSRP is configured for gateway redundancy in critical offices to minimize downtime.
4. DHCP servers dynamically assign IPs to devices in their respective VLANs.

Example Use Case
- Multi-branch enterprises requiring seamless connectivity between locations.
- Scenarios where high availability and network performance are critical.

Files
- Configuration files for each location's network.
- Detailed network topology diagrams.
- Project documentation.
